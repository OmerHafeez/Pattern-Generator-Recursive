# Pattern-Generator-Recursive
Write a recursive function Pattern that print a pattern that takes two-character arguments, and
two integer arguments n and k. n is the starting number while k is the ending limit.
Note: No loops are allowed whatsoever, and you can write a maximum of one helper function
apart from the main function.
Example:
Pattern(1, 4,’^’,’*‘) would print the following pattern.
1*2^^3***4^^^^3***2^^1*
